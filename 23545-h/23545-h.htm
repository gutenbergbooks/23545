Preface
</i>
</p>
<p>
The Romantic poets rediscovered a pastoral and Biblical dream: that a child was the most innocent and the wisest of us all. Wordsworth hailed him as &#34;Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!&#34; And in the next generation Victorian novelists took that dream seriously enough to make children the heroes and heroines of their most searching fictions. There had been no &#34;children's literature&#34; to speak of before, except for the oral and &#34;popular&#34; tradition, including lullabies and
<i>
Mother Goose</i>, some of which go back as far as Tudor and even medieval times.
</p>
<p>
Children's literature today is an immense and complex domain; and leaving aside for the present the works composed by children themselves, what remains varies tremendously in skill and delight, as well as in subtlety and intention. So I shall also set aside those minimal &#34;vocabulary-building&#34; tales and verses whose small virtues are rarely more than therapeutic, and direct myself only to that specialized but most important category&#8212;poems written by a skilled and adult poet but addressed to an audience of children who are likely to be read to until they are skillful enough to read the same verses for themselves.
</p>
<p>
The dangers for the poet in addressing so composite an audience are enormous: cuteness, coyness, archness and condescension are only the most obvious ones. Some great writers of children's verse&#8212;Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear&#8212;have successfully hedged themselves against these dangers by insistent comedy and parody (Carroll's &#34;serious&#34; children's verse is maudlin and embarrassing). By this means they have contrived what the child will take as lovely, unintimidating, mysterious, rational nonsense, and what the adult will recognize as a travesty or burlesque of something very edgy indeed. Thus, Lear's &#34;The Dong with the Luminous Nose&#34; and Carroll's &#34;Jabberwocky&#34; are, respectively, bright and disguised versions of gothic terror and misery on the one hand, and medieval knightly exploit on the other, both rendered innocuous for the nursery and ridiculous for the adult. The risks of seriousness have been successfully avoided.
</p>
<p>
The poetry of Walter de la Mare sings boldly and beautifully without any of these hedges and condescensions. His work has the honest candor of the border ballads and the fairy tales: as well as unmitigated joys, they are full of the dangers and horrors and sorrows that every child soon knows to be part of the world, however vainly parents try to veil them. A child's curiosity about the forbidden will insist on being satisfied; and better by verse than otherwise. This poetry is also musically astute and demanding; it may surprise and alert the parental reader; and it has its share of archaisms and poeticisms, which, contrary to adult surmise, bemuse and fascinate children. And it must be admitted that it is also relentlessly British; but then, so is much good children's literature.
</p>
<p>
As a poet (he was also a gifted novelist and short-story writer) de la Mare was praised by T. S. Eliot (&#34;the delicate, invisible web you wove&#34;) and by W. H. Auden (&#34;there are no good poems which are only for children&#34;). His technical and linguistic skills are not, as Auden rightly points out, a matter of indifference to children, who are in the very business of learning language, as well as other facts of life, and who are particularly sensitive to verbal rhythms, as Iona and Peter Opie have splendidly demonstrated in
<i>
The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren</i>.
</p>
<p>
Just as important, this is a poetry of charms and spells, witches and dwarfs, ogres and fairies, full of dangers, omens, riddles and triumphs. In &#34;The Ogre,&#34; for example, two sleeping children are about to be plucked by an enormous ogre from their home:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Into their dreams no shadow fell
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of his disastrous thumb
</p>
<p>
Groping discreet, and gradual,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Across the quiet room.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
But he is stopped, spellbound, abashed and defeated by the mother of the children, who is in another room and, all unaware of the danger, is singing a version of the Coventry Carol (which, in its original, is addressed to the Christ Child) as a lullaby to her new-born baby.
</p>
<p>
I would guess that any child fortunate enough to grow up with these poems ringing in memory's ear might have a remarkable reservoir of music and excitement available to him. That is not a small gift.

To sing of the buttercups and dew.

<strong>
THE PEDLAR</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
There came a Pedlar to an evening house;
</p>
<p>
Sweet Lettice, from her lattice looking down,
</p>
<p>
Wondered what man he was, so curious
</p>
<p>
His black hair dangled on his tattered gown:
</p>
<p>
Then lifts he up his face, with glittering eyes,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
'What will you buy, sweetheart?&#8212;Here's honeycomb,
</p>
<p>
And mottled pippins, and sweet mulberry pies,
</p>
<p>
Comfits and peaches, snowy cherry bloom,
</p>
<p>
To keep in water for to make night sweet:
</p>
<p>
All that you want, sweetheart,&#8212;come, taste and eat!'
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Ev'n with his sugared words, returned to her
</p>
<p>
The clear remembrance of a gentle voice:&#8212;
</p>
<p>
'And O! my child, should ever a flatterer
</p>
<p>
Tap with his wares, and promise of all joys
</p>
<p>
And vain sweet pleasures that on earth may be;
</p>
<p>
Seal up your ears, sing some old happy song,
</p>
<p>
Confuse his magic who is all mockery:
</p>
<p>
His sweets are death.' Yet, still, how she doth long
</p>
<p>
But just to taste, then shut the lattice tight,
</p>
<p>
And hide her eyes from the delicious sight!
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'What must I pay?' she whispered. 'Pay!' says he,
</p>
<p>
'Pedlar I am who through this wood do roam,
</p>
<p>
One lock of hair is gold enough for me,
</p>
<p>
For apple, peach, comfit, or honeycomb!'
</p>
<p>
But from her bough a drowsy squirrel cried,
</p>
<p>
'Trust him not, Lettice, trust, oh trust him not!'
</p>
<p>
And many another woodland tongue beside
</p>
<p>
Rose softly in the silence&#8212;'Trust him not!'
</p>
<p>
Then cried the Pedlar in a bitter voice,
</p>
<p>
'What, in the thicket, is this idle noise?'
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A late, harsh blackbird smote him with her wings,
</p>
<p>
As through the glade, dark in the dim, she flew;
</p>
<p>
Yet still the Pedlar his old burden sings,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
'What, pretty sweetheart, shall I show to you?
</p>
<p>
Here's orange ribands, here's a string of pearls,
</p>
<p>
Here's silk of buttercup and pansy glove,
</p>
<p>
A pin of tortoiseshell for windy curls,
</p>
<p>
A box of silver, scented sweet with clove:
</p>
<p>
Come now,' he says, with dim and lifted face,
</p>
<p>
'I pass not often such a lonely place.'
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'Pluck not a hair!' a hidden rabbit cried,
</p>
<p>
'With but one hair he'll steal thy heart away,
</p>
<p>
Then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide:
</p>
<p>
Go in! all honest pedlars come by day.'
</p>
<p>
There was dead silence in the drowsy wood;
</p>
<p>
'Here's syrup for to lull sweet maids to sleep;
</p>
<p>
And bells for dreams, and fairy wine and food
</p>
<p>
All day thy heart in happiness to keep';&#8212;
</p>
<p>
And now she takes the scissors on her thumb,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
'O, then, no more unto my lattice come!'
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
O sad the sound of weeping in the wood!
</p>
<p>
Now only night is where the Pedlar was;
</p>
<p>
And bleak as frost upon a too-sweet bud
</p>
<p>
His magic steals in darkness, O alas!
</p>
<p>
Why all the summer doth sweet Lettice pine?
</p>
<p>
And, ere the wheat is ripe, why lies her gold
</p>
<p>
Hid 'neath fresh new-pluckt sprigs of eglantine?
</p>
<p>
Why all the morning hath the cuckoo tolled,
</p>
<p>
Sad to and fro in green and secret ways,
</p>
<p>
With lonely bells the burden of his days?
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And, in the market-place, what man is this
</p>
<p>
Who wears a loop of gold upon his breast,
</p>
<p>
Stuck heartwise; and whose glassy flatteries
</p>
<p>
Take all the townsfolk ere they go to rest
</p>
<p>
Who come to buy and gossip? Doth his eye
</p>
<p>
Remember a face lovely in a wood?
</p>
<p>
O people! hasten, hasten, do not buy
</p>
<p>
His woful wares; the bird of grief doth brood
</p>
<p>
There where his heart should be; and far away
</p>
<p>
Dew lies on grave-flowers this selfsame day!

<p class="i2">
He glowered on the sight.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Into the garden sweet with peas

<p class="i2">
He put his wooden shoe,

<p>
And bending back the apple trees
</p>
<p class="i2">
Crept covetously through;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then, stooping, with an impious eye
</p>
<p class="i2">
Stared through the lattice small,
</p>
<p>
And spied two children which did lie
</p>
<p class="i2">
Asleep, against the wall.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Into their dreams no shadow fell,

Groping discreet, and gradual,

<p class="i2">
Across the quiet room.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But scarce his nail had scraped the cot

<p>
As if his malice were forgot,
</p>
<p class="i2">
It suddenly did stay.

<div class="stanza">
<p>
For faintly in the ingle-nook

<p class="i2">
He heard a cradlesong,

<p class="i2">
Terror them among.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
For she who in the kitchen sat
</p>
<p class="i2">
Darning by the fire,

<p class="i2">

<p>
Stooping o'er that lonely place

Evil in form and face.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>

O leave me, leave me, leave me,
</p>
<p class="i4">

</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The fiends stared down with greedy eye,
</p>
<p>
Fanning the chill air duskily,
</p>
<p>
'Twixt their hoods they stoop and cry:&#8212;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'Shall we smooth the path before you,
</p>
<p class="i4">

</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sprinkle it green with gilded showers,

<p>
Strew it o'er with painted flowers?

Ye three wild fiends!

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Over bog, and fen, and boulder,
</p>
<p>
I must bear it on my shoulder,

Smitten of rain, parched of fire:

<p>
Bright lightning quivered in the gloom,
</p>
<p>
And a faint voice of thunder spake
</p>
<p>
Far in the lone hill-hollows&#8212;'Come!'
</p>
<p>
Then half in fury, half in dread,
</p>
<p>
The fiends drew closer down and said:&#8212;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'Grey old man but sleep awhile;

Youth and solace unto thee.

<div class="stanza">
<p>
With sweet wire and reed we'll haunt you;

<p>
Songs of the valley shall enchant you;
</p>
<p>
Rest now, lest this night you die:
</p>
<p>
Sweet be now our lullaby:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'Grey old man, come sleep awhile,
</p>
<p class="i4">
Stubborn old man!'
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The pilgrim crouches terrified
</p>
<p>
At stooping hood, and glassy face,
</p>
<p>
Gloating, evil, side by side;
</p>
<p>
Terror and hate brood o'er the place;
</p>
<p>
He flings his withered hands on high
</p>
<p>
With a bitter, breaking cry:&#8212;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me,

Ye three wild fiends:

<p>
If I lay me down in slumber,

<p class="i2">
Then I lay me down in wrath;
</p>
<p>
If I stir not in sweet dreaming,

<p class="i2">
Then I wither in my path;

If I hear sweet voices singing,

And even while he spake, the sun
</p>
<p>
From the sweet hills pierced the gloom,
</p>
<p>
Kindling th' affrighted fiends upon.
</p>
<p>
Wild flapped their wings, as if in doom,
</p>
<p>
He heard a dismal hooting laughter:&#8212;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Nought but a little rain fell after,
</p>
<p>
And from the cloud whither they flew
</p>
<p>
A storm-sweet lark rose in the blue:

<p>
And his bundle seemed of flowers

In his solitary hours.

<strong>
AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
As Lucy went a-walking one wintry morning fine,
</p>
<p>
There sate three crows upon a bough, and three times three is nine:
</p>
<p>
Then 'O!' said Lucy, in the snow, 'it's very plain to see
</p>
<p>
A witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then stept she light and heedfully across the frozen snow,
</p>
<p>
And plucked a bunch of elder-twigs that near a pool did grow:
</p>
<p>
And, by and by, she comes to seven shadows in one place
</p>
<p>
All stretched by seven poplar-trees against the sun's bright face.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She looks to left, she looks to right, and in the midst she sees
</p>
<p>
A little well of water clear and frozen 'neath the trees;
</p>
<p>
Then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels,
</p>
<p>
And hears a magic belfry a-ringing with sweet bells.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But when the belfry ceased to sound yet nothing could she see,
</p>
<p>
Save only frozen water in the shadow of the tree.
</p>
<p>
But presently she lifted up her eyes along the snow,
</p>
<p>
And sees a witch in brindled shawl a-frisking to and fro.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her shoes were buckled scarlet that capered to and fro,
</p>
<p>
And all her rusty locks were wreathed with twisted mistletoe;
</p>
<p>
But never a dint, or mark, or print, in the whiteness for to see,
</p>
<p>
Though danced she high, though danced she fast, though danced she lissomely.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
It seemed 'twas diamonds in the air, or little flakes of frost;
</p>
<p>
It seemed 'twas golden smoke around, or sunbeams lightly tost;
</p>
<p>
It seemed an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose:
</p>
<p>
'Nay!' Lucy said, 'it is the wind that through the branches flows.'
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And as she peeps, and as she peeps, 'tis no more one, but three,
</p>
<p>
And eye of bat, and downy wing of owl within the tree,
</p>
<p>
And the bells of that sweet belfry a-pealing as before,
</p>
<p>
And now it is not three she sees, and now it is not four.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'O! who are ye,' sweet Lucy cries, 'that in a dreadful ring,
</p>
<p>
All muffled up in brindled shawls, do caper, frisk, and spring?'
</p>
<p>
'A witch and witches, one and nine,' they straight to her reply,
</p>
<p>
And looked upon her narrowly, with green and needle eye.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold sweet cherry-trees upgrow,
</p>
<p>
And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;
</p>
<p>
She smells all faint the almond-boughs that blow so wild and fair,
</p>
<p>
And doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Clear flow'rs she sees, like tulip buds, go floating by like birds,
</p>
<p>
With wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words;
</p>
<p>
And as with ropes of amethyst the boughs with lamps were hung,
</p>
<p>
And clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'O witches nine, ye dreadful nine, O witches seven and three!
</p>
<p>
Whence come these wondrous things that I this Christmas morning see?'
</p>
<p>
But straight, as in a clap, when she of Christmas says the word,
</p>
<p>
Here is the snow, and there the sun, but never bloom nor bird;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Nor warbling flame, nor gloaming-rope of amethyst there shows,
</p>
<p>
Nor bunches of green emeralds, nor belfry, well, and rose,
</p>
<p>
Nor cloud of gold, nor cherry-tree, nor witch in brindled shawl,
</p>
<p>
But like a dream which vanishes, so vanished were they all.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When Lucy sees, and only sees, three crows upon a bough,
</p>
<p>
And earthly twigs, and bushes hidden white in driven snow,
</p>
<p>
Then 'O!' said Lucy, 'three times three is nine&#8212;I plainly see
</p>
<p>
Some witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'

THE PHANTOM</strong>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'Upstairs in the large closet, child,
</p>
<p class="i2">
This side the blue-room door,
</p>
<p>
Is an old Bible, bound in leather,

<p class="i2">
Standing upon the floor;

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'Go with this taper, bring it me;

Carry it on your arm;

It is the book on many a sea

Hath stilled the waves' alarm.'
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Late the hour, dark the night,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The house is solitary,
</p>
<p>
Feeble is a taper's light
</p>
<p class="i2">
To light poor Ann to see.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her eyes are yet with visions bright
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of sylph and river, flower and fay,
</p>
<p>
Now through a narrow corridor
</p>
<p class="i2">
She takes her lonely way.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Vast shadows on the heedless walls
</p>
<p class="i2">
Gigantic loom, stoop low:
</p>
<p>
Each little hasty footfall calls
</p>
<p class="i2">
Hollowly to and fro.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
In the dim solitude her heart
</p>
<p class="i2">
Remembers tearlessly
</p>
<p>
White winters when her mother was
</p>
<p class="i2">
Her loving company.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Now in the dark clear glass she sees
</p>
<p class="i2">
A taper mocking hers,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
A phantom face of light blue eyes,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Reflecting phantom fears.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Around her loom the vacant rooms,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Wind the upward stairs,
</p>
<p>
She climbs on into a loneliness
</p>
<p class="i2">
Only her taper shares.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her grandmother is deaf with age;
</p>
<p class="i2">
A garden of moonless trees
</p>
<p>
Would answer not though she should cry
</p>
<p class="i2">
In anguish on her knees.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
So that she scarcely heeds&#8212;so fast
</p>
<p class="i2">
Her pent-up heart doth beat&#8212;
</p>
<p>
When, faint along the corridor,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Falleth the sound of feet:&#8212;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sounds lighter than silk slippers make
</p>
<p class="i2">
Upon a ballroom floor, when sweet
</p>
<p>
Violin and 'cello wake
</p>
<p class="i2">
Music for twirling feet.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
O! in an old unfriendly house,
</p>
<p class="i2">
What shapes may not conceal

<p>
Their faces in the open day,
</p>
<p class="i2">
At night abroad to steal?
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Even her taper seems with fear
</p>
<p class="i2">
To languish small and blue;
</p>
<p>
Far in the woods the winter wind
</p>
<p class="i2">
Runs whistling through.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A dreadful cold plucks at each hair,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Her mouth is stretched to cry,
</p>
<p>
But sudden, with a gush of joy,
</p>
<p class="i2">
It narrows to a sigh.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
It is a wilding child which comes
</p>
<p class="i2">
Swift through the corridor,
</p>
<p>
Singing an old forgotten song,
</p>
<p class="i2">
This ancient burden bore:&#8212;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
'Thorn, thorn, I wis,
</p>
<p>
And roses twain,
</p>
<p class="i2">
A red rose and a white,

<p>
Stoop in the blossom, bee, and kiss

<p class="i2">
A lonely child good-night.

'Swim fish, sing bird,

Her raiment wild and yellow as furze

<p class="i2">
That spouteth out the same;

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And in her hand she bore no flower,
</p>
<p class="i2">
But on her head a wreath

<p>
Of faded flag-flowers that did yet
</p>
<p class="i2">
Smell sweetly after death.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Clear was the light of loveliness

And sad the mouth that uttered

<p class="i2">
Her immemorial strain.

Gloomy with night the corridor

No longer seems alone.

Fast though her taper dwindles down,

A beauty beyond fear to dim

<p class="i2">
Haunts now her alien home.

Of dead and restless men.

A child as lone as she&#8212;

Pining for love not found on earth,

<p class="i2">
Ann dreams again to see.

</div>

<p>
Seated upon her tapestry-stool,

<p class="i2">
She hath sweet company.

Light-haired Lallerie

Bitterly quarrelled with Alliolyle

His house as fair as the Malmsey wine

<p class="i2">
Seems sad as cypress-tree.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Three bowls he brims with honeycomb

Saying, 'O bees, be this your home,

At the flowing of the tide;

When ebbed the billow, there was not,

O little elves, her tiny body

<p>
Like a white flake of snow it is,

<p>
Drooping upon the pale green hood

<p class="i4">
Of the chill snowdrop.

<div class="stanza">
<p>
O little elves, with elderflower,

<p>
And pimpernel, and the white hawthorn,

Sprinkle the journey of her dreams:

<p class="i4">
And, little elves,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Call to her magically sweet,
</p>
<p>
Lest of her very tenderness
</p>
<p>
She do forsake this rough brown earth
</p>
<p class="i4">
And return to us no more.

<strong>
I MET AT EVE</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,
</p>
<p>
His was a still and lovely face,
</p>
<p>
He wandered through a valley steep
</p>
<p class="i2">
Lovely in a lonely place.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
His garb was grey of lavender,
</p>
<p>
About his brows a poppy-wreath
</p>
<p>
Burned like dim coals, and everywhere
</p>
<p class="i2">
The air was sweeter for his breath.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
His twilight feet no sandals wore,
</p>
<p>
His eyes shone faint in their own flame,
</p>
<p>
Fair moths that gloomed his steps before
</p>
<p class="i2">
Seemed letters of his lovely name.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
His house is in the mountain ways,
</p>
<p>
A phantom house of misty walls,
</p>
<p>
Whose golden flocks at evening graze,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And witch the moon with muffled calls.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Upwelling from his shadowy springs
</p>
<p>
Sweet waters shake a trembling sound,
</p>
<p>
There flit the hoot-owl's silent wings,
</p>
<p class="i2">
There hath his web the silkworm wound.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Dark in his pools clear visions lurk,
</p>
<p>
And rosy, as with morning buds,
</p>
<p>
Along his dales of broom and birk
</p>
<p class="i2">
Dreams haunt his solitary woods.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,
</p>
<p>
His was a still and lovely face,
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p class="i2">
Lovely in a lonely place.

LULLABY</strong>

<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
</p>
<p>
The singing mouse sings plaintively,
</p>
<p>
The sweet night-bird in the chesnut-tree&#8212;
</p>
<p>
They sing together, bird and mouse,
</p>
<p>
In starlight, in darkness, lonely, sweet,
</p>
<p>
The wild notes and the faint notes meet&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
</p>
<p>
Amid the lilies floats the moth,
</p>
<p>
The mole along his galleries goeth
</p>
<p>
In the dark earth; the summer moon
</p>
<p>
Looks like a shepherd through the pane
</p>
<p>
Seeking his feeble lamb again&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
</p>
<p>
Time comes to keep night-watch with thee
</p>
<p>
Nodding with roses; and the sea
</p>
<p>
Saith 'Peace! Peace!' amid his foam
</p>
<p>
White as thy night-clothes; 'O be still!'
</p>
<p>
The wind cries up the whisp'ring hill&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!

<strong>
ENVOY</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
There clung three roses to a stem,
</p>
<p>
Did all their hues of summer don,
</p>
<p>
But came a wind and troubled them,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And all were gone.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I heard three bells in unison
</p>
<p>
Clap out some transient heart's delight,
</p>
<p>
Time and the hour brought silence on
</p>
<p class="i2">
And the dark night.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Doth not Orion even set!
</p>
<p>
O love, love, prove true alone,
</p>
<p>
Till youthful hearts ev'n love forget,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Then, child, begone!
